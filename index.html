  <h3 class= "col-xs-12 col-md-8 col-md-offset-7">Pushing, Working Harder</h3>
  <p class= "text-justify col-xs-12 col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-3">Every project, Monty would work hours and hours, sometimes without sleep to accomplish what he wanted to make. His life was centered around his work and due to this, he was able to achieve amazing detail in the character designs and the combat scenes that he created. His co-workers at RoosterTeeth remember him most for being the one who pushes the team to get last minute scenes into <em>Red Vs. Blue</em>. Monty always strived for the best, never tolerating any less.</p>
